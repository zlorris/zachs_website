			<h3>Smart Car</h3>

					This project was completed in ENGR 2350 - Embedded Control in Spring 2019. This is a laboratory-based
					course which focuses on developing the hardware and software needed to control a smart car in its
					environment. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C8051">SiLabs C8051 microcontroller</a> was
					used to process data from several embedded hardware components (accelerometer, ultrasonic ranger, compass,
					keypad, LCD screen, pushbuttons, switches, etc.) and control the car's drive motor and steering servo
					accordingly.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the duration of this course I was a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of an electrical
					engineering student, a mechanical engineering student, and myself. I wrote most of the C code
					for the microcontroller because I had the strongest software background. Our team succeeded in implementing
					car functionality for several tasks, two of which are shown in the videos above. In the first video,
					an ultrasonic ranger was used to control the heading of the car as it moved throughout the classroom. In
					the second video, data from an accelerometer was used to turn and stop the car at a specific angle on
					an incline.

					This project was completed in ENGR 2050 - Intro to Engineering Design in Spring 2020. This course focuses
					on familiarizing students with the engineering design process through the semester-long development of a
					product chosen by their team. Technical evaluations, presentations, and reports are used to strengthen
					engineering and professional skills.

					I was a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of an aeronautical engineering student, civil engineering
					student, mechannical engineering student, computer science student, and myself. Our team came up with a
					product called The Smart Fan which uses computer vision to direct air flow towards the user as they move
					throughout their environment to promote cooling efficiency. Each team member was assigned to a subsystem
					which best fit their background. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I was assigned to the microprocessor subsystem, whose purpose was to interpret signals from the human
					detection system and external buttons/switches to control the DC motor for the fan blades and servo
					motor for the fan heading. I used an Arduino UNO as the microcontroller for the subsystem. The
					<a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293.pdf">L239D</a> was used to control both motors. Two
					potentiometers were used to incrementally adjust fan speed and fan heading. The Smart Fan was designed
					to have 3 rotation modes: human detection, oscillation, and stationary. In human detection mode, the
					fan tracks the user as they move. However, to save power, the fan automatically turns off if the user
					is not seen for one minute. It can only be woken with one of the pushbuttons. In oscillation mode, the
					fan rotates back and forth on 180 degree intervals as a normal fan. In stationary mode, the fan
					simply remains still. A circuit and logic diagram for the microprocessor system are shown above.
