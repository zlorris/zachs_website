				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Dedicated RPI student seeking a Summer 2021 internship in the
				Electrical/Computer & Systems Engineering field.</p>
				<p>I am a rising 4th year student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) studying Electrical +
				Computer & Systems Engineering. I graduated from Boiling Springs High School in 2018 as
				salutatorian of my high school class.  As an extremely academically-motivated student, I chose RPI
			  for its strong academic reputation and rigorous coursework.  I have worked hard throughout my studies to achieve
			  a perfect 4.0 GPA.  I have completed several projects pertaining to my interest in software and embedded 
			  systems. I am now seeking to apply my hardware and software knowledge in a position where I can continue to
			  learn and further develop my engineering and professional skills.</p>
			  <p>In my free time, I am a big outdoorsman.  I have fished the creeks and lakes of south central Pennsylvania
			  since a very young age. I recently took up hunting in November 2020.  Below is a picture of a carp that I caught 
				in the Conodoguinet Creek in July 2020.</p>

				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<h3>Smart Car</h3>
					<figure>
						<video src="images/img_2055.mov" height="400" width="300" controls>Ultrasonic Ranger Lab</video>
						<video src="images/img_2063.mov" height="400" width="300" controls>Accelerometer Lab</video>
					</figure>
					<p>
						This project was completed in ENGR 2350 - Embedded Control in Spring 2019. This is a laboratory-based
						course which focuses on developing the hardware and software needed to control a smart car in its
						environment. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C8051">SiLabs C8051 microcontroller</a> was
						used to process data from several embedded hardware components (accelerometer, ultrasonic ranger, compass,
						keypad, LCD screen, pushbuttons, switches, etc.) and control the car's drive motor and steering servo
						accordingly.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the duration of this course I was a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of an electrical
						engineering student, a mechanical engineering student, and myself. I wrote most of the C code
						for the microcontroller because I had the strongest software background. Our team succeeded in implementing
						car functionality for several tasks, two of which are shown in the videos above. In the first video,
						an ultrasonic ranger was used to control the heading of the car as it moved throughout the classroom. In
						the second video, data from an accelerometer was used to turn and stop the car at a specific angle on
						an incline.

				<h3>The Smart Fan</h3>

					<p>
						This project was completed in ENGR 2050 - Intro to Engineering Design in Spring 2020. This course focuses
						on familiarizing students with the engineering design process through the semester-long development of a
						product chosen by their team. Technical evaluations, presentations, and reports are used to strengthen
						engineering and professional skills.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of an aeronautical engineering student, civil engineering
						student, mechannical engineering student, computer science student, and myself. Our team came up with a
						product called The Smart Fan which uses computer vision to direct air flow towards the user as they move
						throughout their environment to promote cooling efficiency. Each team member was assigned to a subsystem
						which best fit their background. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I was assigned to the microprocessor subsystem, whose purpose was to interpret signals from the human
						detection system and external buttons/switches to control the DC motor for the fan blades and servo
						motor for the fan heading. I used an Arduino UNO as the microcontroller for the subsystem. The
						<a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293.pdf">L239D</a> was used to control both motors. Two
						potentiometers were used to incrementally adjust fan speed and fan heading. The Smart Fan was designed
						to have 3 rotation modes: human detection, oscillation, and stationary. In human detection mode, the
						fan tracks the user as they move. However, to save power, the fan automatically turns off if the user
						is not seen for one minute. It can only be woken with one of the pushbuttons. In oscillation mode, the
						fan rotates back and forth on 180 degree intervals as a normal fan. In stationary mode, the fan
						simply remains still. A circuit and logic diagram for the microprocessor system are shown above.
