					<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Dedicated RPI student seeking to utilize my computer hardware and software skills
					as an an aspriring engineer.</p>
					<p>I am a rising 4th year student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) studying Electrical +
					Computer & Systems Engineering. I graduated from Boiling Springs High School in 2018 as
					salutatorian of my high school class.  As an extremely academically-motivated student, I chose RPI
				  for its strong academic reputation and rigorous coursework.  I have worked hard throughout my studies to achieve
				  a perfect 4.0 GPA.  I have completed several projects pertaining to my interest in software and embedded 
				  systems. I am now seeking to apply my hardware and software knowledge in a position where I can continue to
				  learn and further develop my engineering and professional skills.</p>
				  <p>In my free time, I am a big outdoorsman.  I have fished the creeks and lakes of south central Pennsylvania
				  since a very young age. I recently took up hunting in November 2020.  To the right is a picture of a carp that
					I caught in the Conodoguinet Creek in July 2020.</p>
